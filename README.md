# NMSSH

This is a forked project from [original NMSSH](https://github.com/NMSSH/NMSSH). Differences are as follows.

* Changed to Swift Package.
* Libssh2, libssl, libcrypto are removed. You can use [Libssh2Prebuild](https://github.com/Jonge/Libssh2Prebuild) Swift Package to add these libraries.
* SHA256 fingerprint is added.

## Installation

Add NMSSH package with Xcode Swift Package Manager. Enter the following URL in the search box.

`https://github.com/Jonge/NMSSH`

If your project does not already include libssh2, libssl, libcrypto, add Libssh2Prebuild package from Xcode Swift Package Manager. Enter the following URL in the search box.

`https://github.com/Jonge/Libssh2Prebuild`

### Include it in your project

Add `import NMSSH` to your source file for Swift code.

## What does it look like?

```objc
NMSSHSession *session = [NMSSHSession connectToHost:@"127.0.0.1:22"
                                       withUsername:@"user"];

if (session.isConnected) {
    [session authenticateByPassword:@"pass"];

    if (session.isAuthorized) {
        NSLog(@"Authentication succeeded");
    }
}
    
NSError *error = nil;
NSString *response = [session.channel execute:@"ls -l /var/www/" error:&error];
NSLog(@"List of my sites: %@", response);
    
BOOL success = [session.channel uploadFile:@"~/index.html" to:@"/var/www/9muses.se/"];
